<p>In 1996, African American Designer and Design strategist Sylvia Harris wrote a brilliant piece titled, “Searching for a Black Aesthetic in American Graphic Design”. In addition to shedding light on the unfortunate reality of the majority of black designers worldwide, Harris raises several questions in reference to locating and further acknowledging an poorly recognized black design aesthetic. Black, 2 The Future is a visual response and string of project aimed at answering the central question pinned in Harris’s essay: Is there a potential design tradition that can fuel black designers in the same way that black music traditions fuel black musicians? </p>
<p>
My hypothesis is yes. If we can acknowledge that there has been poor documentation and lack of recognition to a black design tradition (due to our Nation's history of racism and classism) – then by widening our lens towards everything that falls under the umbrella of Black expression in art & design, you will not only get a better understanding of the black design aesthetic as it emerges and morphs through the past 100 years, but you will also provide an entry point towards more black contribution in the various design industries with an easier point of reference. That point of reference being identity, and the ability to both identify with the subject matter, the work, and the figures behind the work. </p>
<p>
For Black, 2 The Future it is important to properly frame this piece when referencing the Black Design Aesthetic – a cultural ideology established around the civil rights era in an effort to promote Black identity and seperatism in the arts. After researching the past 100 years of Black art & design, I discovered that there are in fact an enormous variety of Black contribution despite being poorly documented and scarecly referenced in the classroom. Additionally, it is important to note the variety of influence Black expression and Black thought has had on society and popular culture. In alignment with my hypothesis, I decided to frame the Black design aesthetic under three major categories: Visual Art, Communication Design, & Other. This in addition to curating the imagery and references over the past 100 years was my way of inserting myself as the designer into the project.  </p>
<p>
As a black designer and visual artist pursuing his BFA in communication design at Parsons (NY), this thesis experiment selfishly was an attempt at locating Black design throughout history and familiarizing myself with the content before I graduate. My project further manifested into an opportunity to spread awareness on the sbuject and share my discoveries. Targeting young adults from ages 15-23 to engage with the content and eventually participate with this website by submitting both historical and contemporary references to see this collage grow.</p>
